  Eurofever Detailing is an owner-operated studio based in South Austin, founded by Donovan, a lifelong car enthusiast with years of hands-on detailing experience and a deep appreciation for classic European vehicles. As the owner of a small fleet of BMWs himself, Donovan approaches detailing with the mindset of preservation rather than quick transformation, focusing on how a vehicle looks, feels, and ages over time.
  
  Services are primarily studio-based, with mobile appointments available depending on the vehicle and circumstances. Eurofever uses professional- and industry-grade products selected for durability, safety, and long-term results, not short-term shine. Every service is designed around consistency, transparency, and proper maintenance, whether the vehicle is a daily driver or a weekend cruiser.
  
  While the studio naturally gravitates toward enthusiast-owned vehicles, Eurofever is always happy to work with anyone who values careful workmanship and treating a car as something worth keeping.
